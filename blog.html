			<h6><u>Gathering Information for assignment</u></h6>
	 <p>After I found about the assignment I was very excited to work on it.</p>
	 <p>After that,I gathered all the required instrument and information</p>
	 <p> and then started to work on it.At first I thought it was going to be easy</p>
	 <p> but I didnt khow that it was going to turn into a bad dream.</p>

			<h6><u>Beggining of the assignment</u></h6>
	 <p>At first,I started to make my homepage. I started by making navigation as it plays a huge</p>
	 <p>part on the assingment.After that I started to find out about the hamburger icon</p>
	 <p>and it was really hard it took me a couple of hours but at last I wass sucessful in making it.</p> 
	 <p>I choose to keep my bakground as grey as it is the colour of business suit</p>
	 <p>and it stayes in middle ground and provides the colour of resonable agreement, </p>
	 <p>After that I gave introductions and thats how I complted my home page.</p>

		<div class="item-4">
			<h6><u>Conclusion of the assignment</u></h6>
			<p>Potfolio page was easy in comparision to home page. I made
			two boxes in which the images could be kept.</p>
			<p>I also made sure that both portfolio and nav were connected to each other and also made sure that the background remains same as hompeage.</p>
			<p>Contact page was easy due to the fact that our lecturer had just taught us that. I also took the help of university slide which made the contact page look attractive as well as responsive.</p>
			<p>Blog page was intresting one as it reminded me the hardwork,sleepless night I went through to complete my assingmet.It was the page that was personal to me,in comparision to the others.</p>
			<p>Site report page took me almost 2-3 days to complete. It was the page where I was very careful and made sure to give my best to complete it as it contains 10% of my grading.</p>
