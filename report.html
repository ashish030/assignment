		<h1>Experience</h1>
		<p>I studied computer in grade 11 and 12 and was very fascinated.I was taught html,c coding and I was craving for more.I had made up my mind about studing coding in future.
		After completing my 12, I joined Naya Aayam Multidisplinary institute(NAMI) and selected Software Enginering as my major.
		I have to study database,web development and compute system in my first term.
		I love studying practical more than theory due to which my intrest for web development was more in comparision to other. 
		I did all the daily assingment we were given after completing our lecture which became a huge help in my assingment.	
		After getting our assingment I thought it was going to very easy I belong to the computer backgroun but later on it started being one of the hardest obstacle I ever faced. 
		in addition to that after knowing about the restrictions I was shocked and also began to develop fear.
		After that,I had frequent conversation with the lecturer and the process of assingment began slowly. 
		I started by making homepage,portfolio and others as well.I planned to use grey as it is a mild colour and also looks very formal.
		I have thought it like a steping stone to me and in the end I was able to achieve it. I have given it my best and used all the souce of informatio that was avilabel to me.
		I also checked all the code nicely so that I have not problem later on.
		I have loved my experience at NAMI and have wonderful lecturers who make me understand the concept easily and nicely. My friends are very helpful and help me whenever I am in trouble.</p>

		<h1>Module Experience</h1>
		<p>Web development is one of the courses which we study and its module code is CSY1018 for this year.I love practical knowledge more due to which I have loved this subject.
		I get to know a lot about website.I learn a lot of computer laungauge and a lotof coding as well.
		I had many problems while starting and after giving every problem time and using correct method I have been able to overcome it.
		Our lecturer makes sure that we understand all the concepts.
		He suggested me a lot of ideas and also made sure to make me understand the restriction on the assingment and also gave me some advice for my upcoming years.</p>
